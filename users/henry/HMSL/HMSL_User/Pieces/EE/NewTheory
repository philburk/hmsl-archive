* a newer language for MIDI tuning
* make a rexx host to open, accumulate and send the values.
* the idea: use rexxrvi to set the note values up.
* commands and shared variables:
*
* supported values:
* E!		4096(1024) per octave
* PROteus	768
* DX7II		1024
* TX81Z		768?
* Standard	new tuning standard!
* 
* 'ListDest   listing filename' (else Ram:TunaList)
* 
* the actual tunings are set with 
* 'Tune  xxx  value'
* xxx can be:
*       (d: -> octave)
*      a note number 0..127,
*     midi note name 5:C = note 60,5:bb,6:b# or bs
*     relative note number (to last) + or -
* value can be:
*     in Hertz   (valid number)
*     As an ET note   5:BB etc
*     as just ratio   5:3/2  = 4:6/2 = 3:12/2
*     as cents: 5:%323.3
*     with hard coded  adjustments:
*      +1/4	+25 Cents      -1/4	-25 Cents
*      +com
* 
* 'ZeroTuning'
*
* 'Save filename format (,format..)' 
* saves the list as an appropriate Sysex or appended sysexes
*   (same tuning expressed in many ways)
* 'Transmit format' sends block out to "live" buffer
* 'SetBank format'  sets a bank
* 'GetBank format'  gets a bank
* 'Read filename' reads first in the list
* 'REceive format' asks MIDI
