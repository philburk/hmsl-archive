Here is some doc on these HMSL files:


EE is a file which requires locals ( .rstack, Locals) and the new
floating point package "Float.ffp". This package is only available
after JForth 1.3. there may be some junk left on the stack - 
I'm not sure whence it comes. I also use "Fexp" which is easily
added to your float.ffp package.

It provides a number of words for building scales for a few tunable
synthesizers: the DX7/E!, TX81Z and two Mirage systems (note: Soundprocess
doesn't work yet in Jforth ... Triton is updating the tuning system 
anyway). Also, a few words are given for creating primative scores.

A tuning program (or scoring program...) which uses the EE system
may start with the proper environment word:
 ENVIR:E!, ENVIR:Lord , ENVIR:SProc, ENVIR:TX81Z, or Envir:List
 Envir:PROteus ENVIR:DX7II

The default is ENVIR:E!. This correctly sets EE to make System exclusives
for the target machine,  or lists in the case of Upward Concepts'
disk or "Envir:List", which gives the tuning as a table.

Next, you must must must say Start-List to initialize the MIDI and perhaps
the synthesizer.

  Now you can use any of the powers of Forth to feed
numbers to the word E!> .

E!> is the basic operating ingredient of EE .
     E!> ( NoteNum Points)

 translates the points into the correct SYSEX format
for that note. In some systems (e.g. Soundprocess), the note is stored 
in an array and not transmitted until the END-LIST is encountered.

@% ( notenum Octave points -- notenum+1) is a convenient way
to send point values to consecutive spots on a keyboard. You must
"Prime" the word with a MIDI notenumber, and drop the extra number
when you are done, but it saves some headaches.

%% ( notenum octave numerator denominator -- notenum+1 )
 I use extensively for making just ratios, as wth @% above. By the way,
%? ( octave numerator denominator -- result in points ) is a nice
thing to have around. 

Finally, you must use "End-list" when you finish.

Also of note: ENVIR:Ding! is a switch which will transmit the
note you have just tuned while you tune it (if you are a DX7/E!).

ENVIR:LISTPT means print envir:Lists in points. 
ENVIR:LISTCt means print envir:Lists in cents. 

Words which all start with @ are "point" versions of popular equal
tempered notes. E.G. @E = 1365 points , where there are 4096 points
to the octave (my internal standard, which corresponds to E!s as well.)
There are some additional adjustments you can make to the 12et notes
with a few other words: 
 @F @1/4+ will give you f, a quartertone sharp. see EE for more examples.

Sometimes, you want a MIDI notenumber, but cant remember it offhand.
The midi notes are coded as <octave> \name, e.g. 6 \Ab = 80. Middle C
is  5 \C (= 60) and "440 hertz" is usually 4 \A.



The basic syntax for use on your machine is to make words which  say:

\ this is the file Thirds, included here
\
\ first insure that ee is loaded...
\
include?  ee.spot ee:ee
\
\ do anew to guarantee fresh words
\
anew j1.spot
\
\ Harmonize...
\
\ this word types a value before sending it
\
: @.% dup . @% ;
\
\ here is the word for real:
\
: Thirds
start-list   \ initialize midi and other things
0	\ this is the first note-number
11 0 do  \ repeat for 11 octaves, please 
\    this will make 11 * 12 = 132 notes : the extra ones will be ignored
dup . ." :" \ say which octave group
\
\ the food for @.% is <note-number> <octave> <notename>
\ it registers the tuning, and spits out
\ <notenumber + 1>
\ so you can concentrate on making the tuning fit.
\
\ the "@note" words are constants with the 12-ET values of notes
\ stuck in them
\ so 0 i @e @.%  means note number 0 is the e in the ith octave.
\ ( the intended  notes usually follow in comments )
\
\ this file makes a tuning where the keys play thirds above 
\ the real notes.. but not just major thirds...

i @e @.%  \ C
i @e @.%  \ C#
i @F @.%  \ D
i @F @.%  \ Eb
i @G @.%  \ E
i @A @.%  \ F
i @A @.%  \ F#
i @B @.%  \ G
i @B @.%  \ Ab
i 1+ @C  @.%  \ A   maps an octave higher (new octave at c)
i 1+ @C @.%  \ Bb
i 1+ @D @.%  \ B
cr
loop  \ end of this octave, get next

end-list \ finished with the tuning
drop \ remove the excess note-number, which remains on stack.
; 

and that's it!   

There are a healthy number of just 11-limit, 5-limit and 3-limit
tunings in TJ11 , each with a whimsical name.
Note how some remap the keys so that "octaves" are really fifths
and notes are clustered for easy access to the 11th and 9ths.

Chrom contains a mapping for the chromelodeon, which is a retuned 
harmonium used in many of Harry Partch's pieces.

If anyone has the "real" Dx7II or the EPS or SQ80 tuning sysex scheme, 
I'd like to include it!

Obviously, this file is useless without HMSL, available from 
 Frog Peak Music, Po Box 151051 San Rafael CA 94915-1051
 (415) 461-1442
which in turn requires Jforth on Amiga or on Macintosh.


----- notes:

Soundprocess is an odd fish.  It takes a table of up to 132 notes , which
it uses for transposing purposes.  Since an S'Proc voice can have four
oscillators in it, each transposed in a different direction, this can cause
headaches when the tuning is not octave based in groups of 12.
Furthermore, the first "slot" is used for tuning note #36 (the bottom of
the Mirage keyboard) and not note #0.  Transposing (parm [97]) adjusts the
pointer upward, but not downward.  You may fiddle with parm [69] and parm
[71] to retune the oscillators lower. This is not a big problem if you
intend to use S'Proc by itself, but it may be easier to customize the other
machine's patches.
