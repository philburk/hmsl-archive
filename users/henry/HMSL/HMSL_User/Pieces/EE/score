\
\ some kind of scoring test
\
\
\ the stupid score list structure : 

:Struct SCList
long	scl_lower	\ id number of this element
long	scl_higher	\ id number of this element
long	SCL_Time	\ absolute time
byte	SCL_TType	\ type of timing etc.
byte	SCL_MIDI	\ type of MIDI signal if not non/off
short	SCL_Track	\ track number
byte	SCL_Chan	\ channel number
byte	SCL_Note	\ note number
byte	scl_Vel		\ velocity (basic)
long	scl_Non		\ NON cue
long	scl_Nof		\ NOFF cue
;struct

\ types:
0 K: SCT_MARKER	\ a barline or something like that
1 K: SCT_ABS	\ absolute timing in here
2 K: sct_rel	\ relative timing

0 K: SCTM_Non	\ a noteon/off
1 K: SCTM_PB	\ a pitchbend


\ use & and ^ to be various markers???
: & ( create a new element, insert it into tree )

\ in theory, all you need is wait and send bytes.
\ in practice, this would drive me nuts.
\ what i'll do is make some lists and sort them together to produce
\ the stupid output.
end-list
