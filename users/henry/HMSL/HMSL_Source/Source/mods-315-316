Modifications between HMSL vesion 3.15 and 3.16

Check for object stack overflow in OB.COLL.LOOP .
If a player had a repeat count of 0 inside a collection
with a high repeat count then the object stack would overflow.

Expanded Object Stack to 256 bytes.

Added USE->REL to OB.PRELOAD.CFAS in ODE for Macintosh.

Changed Shape Editor so that HMSL.EDIT.PLAY brings up
desired shape.  Used to always edit first shape in SHAPE-HOLDER.

Amiga Only:

PERIOD>OCTAVE: no longer duplicates the lowest octave
in IFF files with multisamples.

Added PLAY_SAMPLE demo.


Macintosh Only:

HMSL window now highlights properly.

EV_MOUSEUP now has proper mouse x,y.

Copyright message now scrolls past area blanked by MultiFinder.
