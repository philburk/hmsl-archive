Changes between HMSL Amiga versions 3.14 and 3.15

---- Changes to Instruments -------------------------

* Instruments are now subclasses of OB.LIST.
  Notes are tracked and are turned off individually
  when NOTE.OFF: is called.  Allows a mix of calls to
  NOTE.OFF: and LAST.NOTE.OFF:

* Calling NOTE.ON: with velocity = 0 calls NOTE.OFF:

* ALL.OFF: ( -- ) added to OB.MIDI.INSTRUMENT to turn all
    hanging notes off.  Called automatically from CLOSE:.

* A count of how many times an instrument is OPENed or CLOSEd
  is kept allowing an instrument to be shared.

---------------------------------------------------------

* SCRAMBLE: ( start end dim -- , reorder values )
  added to OB.SHAPE . Available from shape editor.

* EXTEND: now does a NEW: if it has not been done before.
  It used to crash.

* START: declaration removed from WAVEFORMS file.

* STOP: declaration removed from ENVELOPES file.
