Memo to HMSL 3.0 Users from Phil Burk
6/17/87

HMSL 3.1 software is different from 3.0 in the following ways:

* The MIDI Parser now supports System Common and System
Real Time messages. This allows HMSL to be controlled from
an external sequencer using START and STOP, etc.  Active
Sensing no longer causes problems.  MP.CHANNEL@ gets MIDI
channel of last incoming message.  The MIDI Parser
is now an integral part of the multitasker and has
a much faster response to MIDI keyboard input.

* Vectored TIME@ to allow software based timing as well as
hardware timing.  Added TIME! and TIME+! .

* Improved ODE.  Now approx. 30% faster and uses the
Object Stack more efficiently when referencing SELF.

* Forth ABORT now triggers cleanup of HMSL to avoid
getting into "nasty" states.

* PRINT: method improved for Translators, Instruments,
Control Grids and others. Now prints more information.

* Perform Screen improved.  Probabilities that control
action priorities can now be controlled interactively
from screen.  The MIDI Parser can be toggled on/off
from this screen.  The PERFORM button will now
always reflect the true state of whether PERFORM is on.
Drawing has been sped up.  Unweighted behavior greatly
sped up.

* Morphs can now be reexecuted even if they are already
executing.  They will send STOP: messages down the tree
to stop themselves and all executing component morphs.
Then restart execution.

* Two words have been added to help clean up after
executing a piece. FREE.HIERARCHY will free all allocated
memory for an entire hierarchy. DEFAULT.HIERARCHY will
set all parameters to their default state for an entire
hierarchy.  DEFAULT: will work on one Morph.

* 0STUFF: is a new method for Collections to simplify
the building of hierarchies.

* A new class of Morph call "JOB" has been added. These
provide background tasks that repeat some Forth function
at a specified duration.  Useful for rhythm experiments
by changing durations.

* Several new examples have been added that demonstrate MIDI
Parsing, Gamuts, Jobs, Algorithmic Composition, DUMP.SOURCE:,
etc.

* A function called INTERP for interpolating values along a
line has been added.

* A 1/F Noise function has been added.

* A repeat count of 0 will now work to disable a Morph.

* Actions will now be evenly distributed among the four
priorities by default, instead of randomly distributed.

* Several small bugs have been fixed.

* (Internal note.) AO.POST no longer calls REGISTER: so
the stack diagram has been changed to:

    AO.POST  ( morph -- )

* Translators can now be customized so that they will use
an optional translation function instead of a table lookup.

----- Amiga Specific Changes ---------------------------

* Amiga Instruments now allocate channels when opened.

* Equal Tempered Tuning (TUNING-EQUAL) extended to 5 octaves.

------------------
The following items have NOT made it into this Version. Sorry.

* No IFF sample files.

* No Hierarchy or Structure Editor.
