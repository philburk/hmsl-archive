HMSL version 3.12 differs from version 3.10 in
the following ways.

* Unimplemented pull down menu items have been removed.

* H:HMSL_TOP has been split into:
    h:ajf_open
    h:ajf_top
    h:hmsl_top
    h:ajf_startup
  in order to isolate host dependancies better.

* The REVERSE: method for SHAPES has been changed so
  that it doesn't use such huge ammounts of stack space.
  In the past, this occasionally resulted in stack overflows
  into the dictionary when reversing large SHAPES.

* DEBUG.TYPE added to HO:UTILS

* Version number now prints at startup. Available
  as a constant named HMSL_VERSION# .

Last minute BUG report:

- A shape with an ON dimension will get out of sync if
  an ON time of zero is in the shape.  The PLAYER will
  mess up the time.
  ( Now Fixed! )

---- Amiga Specific ------------

** Incorrect values in the bottom two octaves of TUNING-EQUAL
  have been fixed.

** References to JO: in H:LOAD_HMSL changed to HO: so
  that the new version of ODE gets loaded.
