   This document describes TEXTRA, a very user-friendly text editor.  So
user-friendly, I hope, that you could use it without reading a manual.
Good learning philosophy: play with it.  One of the easiest, that's
the goal.

   TEXTRA is freely distributable.  However, please insure that the
'doc' files & rexx scripts accompany the executable if passed around.

   If you are using TEXTRA to read this file, just point the mouse
at the arrow in the lower-right corner, and hold the left mouse button
down.  You'll know when to let up.

   TEXTRA was written in JForth Professional, which I recommend highly.
As far as I know, TEXTRA is enforcer-clean under WB 2.04.

                                            Thanx,  Mike Haas

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. INVOKING TEXTRA

1.1 TEXTRA may be launched in all of the various ways the Amiga
permits.

1.2 TEXTA may double-clicked from Workbench (probably the most
common means of starting it).  Workbench Extended-Selection mode
is implemented to provide opening a specific set of document icons.
For information about this mode, refer to your Workbench manual.

1.3 "TEXTRA" may be typed into the CLI or SHELL, with as many
optional filenames as the AmigaDOS command line will allow.
For example...

	1> RUN TEXTRA <filename1> <filename2> ... <filenameX>

1.4 A "Project" icon that has TEXTRA specified in its "Default Tool"
field will invoke TEXTRA, when double-clicked, and be opened in its
own window.

1.5 TEXTRA will not launch twice.  If a newly-launched TEXTRA finds
another TEXTRA already running, it will present a notification requester
then exit.  (This will probably be changed in future versions to do
much smarter things, like pass the names of any files to the running
program before exiting).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. THE TEXTRA CURSOR

2.1 The current cursor location (where text will be inserted) is
represented by a thin line, of a different color than either text
or background.  The cursor marks the place where newly-typed
characters will be inserted, characters following will 'shift right'.

2.2 The cursor may be moved with the "arrow" keys on the keyboard; a
SHIFT-left-arrow or SHIFT-right-arrow will move the cursor to the
beginning or end of the current line, respectively.

2.3 The cursor may also be positioned by clicking the LEFT MOUSE
BUTTON, while the mouse cursor is over a part of the windows text area.

2.4 The display will move to display the cursor when the F3 key
is pressed (unless visible already).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. ENTERING TEXT INTO THE DOCUMENT

3.1 As keys are typed at the keyboard, they are entered in the file
at the current cursor location, and the cursor is advanced by one.

3.2 The RETURN key inserts a new line, and moves the cursor there.

3.2.1 If the Auto-Indent mode is enabled (see section 8.4.8), the
cursor will align with the line above when the RETURN key is pressed.

3.3 The BACKSPACE deletes the character to the immediate left of the
cursor and backs the cursor up one column.  If the cursor is at the
leftmost column, the preceeding newline is removed and the cursor
moves up one line.

3.3.1 The Auto-BackSpace mode (section 8.4.8), if enabled, comes into
play when the cursor rests on the 1st non-blank character of a line.
Then, the line is "backed-up" by whatever it takes to line up with
the beginning of the text on the line above.  If the previous line
does not start to the left of the cursor line, the alignment is made
to the next line above that does.

3.4 The DELETE key removes the character to the immediate right of the
cursor.  If the cursor is at the end of a line, the newline is removed
and the next line moves up to merge with the current.

3.5 The TAB key advances the cursor to the next column that is an
even multiple of the TAB width value (section 3.5.1).

3.5.1 Settable TAB WIDTH (section 8.4.8) provides a way of changing
the default TAB width (4).  A string requester is presented, with
the currently installed size.  Maximum width accepted is 16.  The
setting applies to all windows.

3.6 Normally, TEXTRA will not allow control characters into the
window, permitting only visible or white-space characters.  This
feature can be temporarily defeated, for 1 character, by pressing F2.
Following F2, the next character will be accepted into the window
unfiltered.

3.7 The HELP key will display an informational requestor, displaying
information about the functions that are available from the keyboard.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. SELECTING A RANGE OF TEXT

4.1 It is possible to mark a series of characters for the next
operation by "dragging" with the mouse.  The sequence is:

  a. Position the mouse over the 1st character of the desired series.
  b. Press the left mouse button and, while holding it down, move the
     mouse to the last character of the series (even if it is on another
     line).  Note that the characters between that clicked-on and wherever
     you move the mouse become "highlighted" (selected).
  c. Release the left mouse button when the desired range of characters
     is selected.

4.2 Any series of non-white characters will become selected if the
LEFT MOUSE BUTTON is double-clicked while the mouse cursor is
positioned over them.  If the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON is triple-clicked,
the entire line that the cursor is pointing to is selected.

4.3 When a range of text is selected, a subsequent operation will
affect the entire selected area.  For example, if a key is typed while
a range is selected, the range will be cut from the file, replaced by
that key.  Other examples are the BACKSPACE and DEL keys, which both
act to simply delete any selected area.  Certain items under the EDIT
menu, described later, also operate on any current range.

4.4 If, while selecting text, the mouse is moved near the bottom or top
of the window, available text in the appropriate direction will scroll
into view, becoming selected in the process.  Therefore, a select range
can extend past the visible limits of the window.

4.5 The display will move to the beginning of any currently-selected
range when the F3 key is pressed.

4.6 A select range may be established or size changed by holding
down the SHIFT key when clicking in the window.  If the click occurs
outside the current select range, the range is extended to there.
If inside, the end-point of the select range is adjusted to the
click-point.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. VIEWING PAGES

5.1 The easiest method for moving through the file is to use the vertical
scroll bar on the right side of the window.  Single clicks of the left
mouse button on the arrows at either end move the document vertically
in continuous scroll fashion.

5.2 The "thumb" in the middle of the scroll bar not only indicates the
visible-page-area relative to the total-file-size (by it's height),
but also the position within the file (by its vertical positioning).
It can also be "selected" with the left mouse button and moved as
a "coarse adjust".  The area immediately above and below the "thumb"
may be clicked with the left button as a "page-scroll" mechanism.

5.3 Another method by which text may be scrolled into view is to move
the cursor, via the keyboard "arrow" keys, to either the top or bottom
of the visible window.  Attempts to move the cursor "off the window"
will cause text in that direction to scroll.

5.4 Function keys F4 and F5 will PAGE the display down and up,
respectively.  The Shift-UP/DOWN-arrow-key combinations will also PAGE
the display in the appropriate direction AND position the cursor
to the middle of the new page.

5.5 The horizontal scroll gadget works similarly to the vertical
scroll gadget.  It becomes functional when a line is being displayed
that exceeds the current width of the window.  Note that the display
will auto-scroll when typing to center the cursor when it traverses
the window edge.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. TEXTRA WINDOWS

6.1 TEXTRA allows any number of windows, limited by the amount of
memory in your computer (most limiting is possibly the amount of
available CHIP ram).  Textra lines can be up to 255 characters long,
number of lines limited by your total available memory (entire file
is kept in ram, FAST is grabbed first).

6.2 The title of each TEXTRA window is set to the full-pathname
of the file that was read in (or created).  This is also the name
of the file that will be written during a SAVE operation (unless
the "SAVE AS..." menu option is chosen, section 8.2.6).  If the
file has been modified since last saved, the filename will be
preceeded by a '*'.

6.3 Each window includes a standard Intuition close gadget, which
performs the same action as the "CLOSE FILE" menu option.  See the
discussion on "CLOSE FILE" (section 8.2.8) for more information.

6.4 The "sizing" gadget in the lower-right hand corner of each window
may be used to adjust the dimensions of that window, up to the
full-screen limitations of the Workbench.

6.5 Function key F1 may be used as a "window-size-toggle" between
default size (when F1 was first hit) and full-screen (as per current
screen resolution settings).  This is particularly
useful when Workbench is in 400 line interlace.

6.6 Function key F6 will cycle through and present each file loaded
by the editor.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. THE TEXTRA-AREXX PORT

7.1 When TEXTRA starts up, it opens a message port called "TEXTRA".
This port listens for AREXX messages from other programs, and allows
you to control the editor both from other applications or from AREXX
"scripts".  These scripts may contain a mixture of AREXX and TEXTRA
commands; they allow access to many internal TEXTRA editing functions
which may be performed on the 'current' window.

7.2 TEXTRA/AREXX scripts or commands may be executed via the "AREXX..."
menu item (section 8.5.3).

7.3 Please refer to the accompanying file "RexxCommand.doc" for a
description of the TEXTRA/AREXX command set as well as general
information about writing your own scripts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


8. TEXTRA MENUS

8.1 4 menus are available and present themselves when the RIGHT
MENU BUTTON is depressed and held.  Some menu items may also
be activated by simultaneously pressing the RIGHT AMIGA key
and the one that is specified in the menu item text.  A list of
such menu "key equivalents" presents itself, as part of the HELP
key facility (section 3.7).

8.2 The "Project" Menu

8.2.1 OPEN A FILE... opens a new window with a full file-selector
requester and buttons that allow quick access to the top 6 disk
devices (like DF0:).  The PARENT button changes the current directory
to the level above the one being displayed.  The KEYBOARD button
presents the user with a string requester into which a file or
directory specification may be typed.  The CANCEL button exits the
requester with no other action while the OK button enters the file
or directory selected in the list box (the same as CANCEL if nothing
is selected).  Double-clicking one of the names performs the same
action as the OK button.

8.2.2 OPEN BY NAME... opens a new window, then presents a string
requester for specifying the filename from the keyboard, bypassing
the directory scan for the list of names (which can take time on
large directories, especially on floppy drives).  Note that the
current directory of the requester is that of the spawning window.
If a pathname is typed into this requester, the "OPEN A FILE" selector
requester is opened, presenting a list of the files in that directory.

8.2.3 NEW FILE opens a window without specifying a filename; the
default name "Untitled" is assigned, at the directory level of
the spawning window.

8.2.4 REVERT TO SAVED causes the read-in version of the selected
file to be discarded, replaced by the version that was last-saved
to disk.  A verification requester is presented to make sure this
is not done accidently.

8.2.5 SAVE FILE causes the currently-selected file to be written to
disk, if modified.  If the file has not been changed (no '*' before
the title), this menu item is disabled.

8.2.6 SAVE FILE AS... allows saving the currently selected file under
a different name.  After this operation, the title bar will contain
the new name, and it will have been created on disk.  If the
specified file already exists, the user is warned and given a
chance to abort.  The "USE LIST" button will present a full
file-requester through which an existing file may be selected with
the mouse.  This requester is very similar in operation to the
"OPEN FILE..." requester; all buttons work the same, except the
OK button will overwrite the selected file (as does double-clicking
a filename).

8.2.7 SAVE ALL FILES causes all files that have been modified and not
saved to be written to disk.  If there are no modified files, this
menu item is disabled.

8.2.8 CLOSE FILE will check if the file has been modified but not
saved and warn the user if so.  Note that closing TEXTRA's last window
will cause it to exit; a requester will notify you if you are closing
the last window and give you the chance to abort.

8.2.9 PRINT FILE prints (to the printer.device) the currently selected
window using the current preference settings (section 8.2.10).  While
a print job is in progress, other windows may be edited, but not printed.
Print jobs may be cancelled at any time.

8.2.10 PRINTING PREFERENCES... presents a dialog to allow the user to
specify whether or not to print 1). a one-line page header at the top
of each page noting the date, filename and page number and 2). preceed
each line with its sequential number in the file.  Note that TEXTRA also
observes the system 'Preferences' settings for left & right margin,
characters-per-line, and lines-per-page (use your system 'Preferences'
tool to set these).  The USE button causes the currently displayed
settings to go into effect.  The USE+SAVE button does the USE function,
and also saves the current settings in the Textra Preferences file (sec-
tion 9.5).  The CANCEL button causes any currently displayed settings
(that have been changed), to be discarded.  If the PRINT PREFERENCES
requester is active, this menu item is disabled from other windows.

8.2.11 ABOUT TEXTRA is self-explanatory.

8.2.12 QUIT will exit TEXTRA, closing all files in the process.  All
files that have been modified but not saved will issue a notification
requester, providing the opportunity to save at that time.

8.3 The "Windows" Menu

8.3.1 One item exists in the "WINDOWS" menu for each open file, the
menu item text being the same as the title bar for the associated
window.  Selecting an item makes it the current window, if not
already.

8.3.2 Additionally, the text includes the "*" character before the
filename if the file has been modified since last written to disk.
A checkmark preceeds the item representing the current file.

8.4 The "Edit" Menu

8.4.1 CUT removes the selected range of characters from the 
currently-selected file, but saves them in the TEXTRA clip area
(TEXTRA does not interface with the standard Amiga Clipboard
Device...future versions may do so).  The previous contents of
the TEXTRA clip area are lost.  If there is no select range,
this menu item is disabled.

8.4.2 COPY moves the selected range of characters of the 
currently-selected file to the TEXTRA clip area, but does not
remove them from the file.  The previous contents of the TEXTRA
clip area are lost.  If there is no select range, this menu
item is disabled.

8.4.3 PASTE inserts whatever is in the TEXTRA clip area into the
currently-selected file, at the current cursor location.  If a select
range is active in this file, it is deleted before the insertion takes
place.  There is no effect on the contents of the TEXTRA clip area.
It nothing has been placed into the TEXTRA clip area (via CUT or COPY),
this menu item is disabled.

8.4.4 FIND presents a sub-menu with 2 choices:

8.4.4.1 STRING... presents a requester prompting for the string
to search for, ignoring character case.  The string gadget will, as
a default, contain the previous string searched for (empty if none).
However, if a range of characters is selected that is ALL ON ONE
LINE, it will supercede any previously-searched-for string as the
default for the string gadget.  The search begins just past the
current cursor location or selected range of characters.

8.4.4.1.1 WRAP... On the FIND STRING requester is a checkbox that
allows you to enable "wrap-around" search.  Normally, if the search
string is not found, TEXTRA terminates the search at the end of the
document.  With the "wrap" box checked, the search will continue from
line 1, and end when either the text is found, or the starting line
is reached.  This mode also applies to the "FIND NEXT OCCURENCE" menu
item (section 8.4.4.2).

8.4.4.2 NEXT OCCURENCE conducts another case-insensitive search
for the same text string that had previously been searched for.
If no search had yet been conducted the "STRING..." requester is presented.

8.4.5 REPLACE presents a sub-menu with 2 choices:

8.4.5.1 STRING... presents a double-string-requester, prompting for
1). the string to conduct a case-insensitive search for, and 2). a
string to replace the first with, when found.  The RETURN key will
toggle the selected string gadget.  The user may optionally 1). replace
all instances of the found string (with the "ALL" button), 2). replace
just the next one found (via the "ONCE" button), or 3). abort (via
"CANCEL").  The search begins just past the current cursor location
or selected range of characters.

8.4.5.2 NEXT OCCURENCE conducts another "REPLACE" operation, using the
same strings that were used last time.  If none exist, the "STRING..."
requester is presented.

8.4.6 CASE presents a sub-menu with 3 choices:

8.4.6.1 LOWER exhibits 2 behaviors depending on whether an area
is selected or not.  If there is, the entire selected area is converted
to lower case.  If not, the next word after the cursor is searched for
and converted to lower case if found. 

8.4.6.2 UPPER exhibits 2 behaviors depending on whether an area
is selected or not.  If there is, the entire selected area is converted
to upper case.  If not, the next word after the cursor is searched for
and converted to upper case if found. 

8.4.6.3 CAPITALIZE exhibits 2 behaviors depending on whether an area
is selected or not.  If there is, each word in the selected area is
located and capitalized.  If not, the next word after the cursor is
located and capitalized. 

8.4.7 GO TO LINE... presents a string requester prompting for the
desired line number, with the initial string gadget contents being
equal to the current cursor line (or the beginning of any selected
range).  First line of file is considered line 1.

8.4.8 EDITING PREFERENCES... presents a requester allowing the selection
of modes and settings, specifically, the "Auto-Indent" mode (section
3.2.1), the "Auto-BackSpace" mode (section 3.3.1), the TAB WIDTH
(section 3.5.1), and the "Convert CR,LF to LF" mode (section 9.6).
   The USE button causes the currently displayed settings to go into effect.
The USE+SAVE button does the USE function, and also saves the current
settings in the Textra Preferences file (section 9.5).  The CANCEL button
causes any currently displayed settings (that have been changed), to be
discarded.  If the EDITING PREFERENCES requester is active, this menu item
is disabled from other windows.

8.5  The "Utilities" Menu

8.5.1  FILE PROTECTIONS... provides the ability to set the 6 relevant
file protection bits that are stored and processed by AmigaDOS.  These
include Deletable, Executable, Writable, Readable, Archived and Script
(particularly handy when writing AmigaDOS scripts).  The SAVE button
causes the currently displayed settings to become active.  The CANCEL
button is self-explanatory.

8.5.2  HELP ON KEYBOARD... performs the same action as the HELP key
(section 3.7).

8.5.3  AREXX... presents a requester with 4 string gadgets.  Each
will accept either the name of an available TEXTRA-AREXX script such as:

	slide 4

or a TEXTRA/AREXX command line such as:

	@gotoxy 0 0;text "Hi, there!"

Note that if a command line is entered (as opposed to a script name),
it must be preceeded by an '@' character.
   Also present on the requester is a button beside each string
gadget.  Clicking it has the same effect as selecting a string gadget and
pressing RETURN...that is, to execute the contents of the string gadget.
The button text describes the F-KEY that will execute the string gadget
contents when the requester is NOT active.
   Two additional buttons are presented, one to SAVE the current strings
for later reloading when TEXTRA is launched.  The other button is to
CANCEL the requester operation.  (The string gadget contents are saved
in "S:TEXTRA.CMDS" which is only as large as the length of the 4 strings
plus 4 EOL characters).
   Note that the AREXX menu item is dimmed if AREXX is not available when
TEXTRA is launched.
   The supplied TEXTRA/AREXX scripts, as well as any you might otherwise
aquire, should be copied to your REXX: directory and should end in
".textra".

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


9. TEXTRA GENERAL INFORMATION

9.1 TEXTRA always fully expands a specified file or directory name
and uses that form to again find the file, if necessary.  For example,
you may have typed in "DF1:MyFile" as the filename, but the window
title will substitute the name of the volume, possibly "MyDisk:MyFile".
This is almost always desirable, because if TEXTRA saved "DF1:", you
might unknowingly save it to the wrong disk, just because you switched
the disk in that drive.  TEXTRA will ask you specifically for the same
name.
   The only situation you should be aware of is WHEN YOU HAVE TWO
DISKS OF THE SAME NAME in your system.  In this case, AmigaDOS can
sometimes choose the wrong disk when TEXTRA passes the full-pathname
to it.
  In the above example, we could save it to the wrong disk if the disk
in DF0: is also named "MyDisk:" (a backup, perhaps???).  This is not
caused by TEXTRA, but can happen anytime in AmigaDOS that you use the
full-pathname to specify a file.

9.2 Intuition provides two String Gadget shortcuts that can be
useful to the TEXTRA user.  TEXTRA string gadgets that provide
a default text string when they appear will revert back to this
string whenever "Right Amiga-Q" is pressed.  The "Right Amiga-X"
combination will clear any displayed string.

9.3 For most string gadgets, the RETURN key will perform the same
action  as the "OK" button.  An example exception is the
"REPLACE" double-string requester, where the RETURN key toggles
between the two string gadgets.

9.4 TEXTRA Requesters are attached to (drawn in) the window that they
have been spawned from.  The advantage is that multiple requesters
are possible...you can select and work in another file even if
the previous window is waiting for you to answer a question.  Every
window can, in fact, have an open requester.
  Note that a TEXTRA window will automatically increase in size
to accomodate a given requester, and will return to it's original
position/size when the requester is closed.

9.5 TEXTRA maintains certain user-settable parameters in the file
"devs:Textra.prefs".  If your system disk is of the floppy variety,
you may therefore be asked to insert this disk if you elect to save it.
Normally, TEXTRA looks for this file only once, at startup.

9.6 Whenever TEXTRA reads in a file (as a result of an OPEN or
REVERT operation, for example), any CR,LF (Carraige Return, Line Feed)
combinations will be automatically converted to the standard Amiga
End-of-Line representation (Line Feed alone) IF the "Convert CR,LF to
CR" item is checked in the "Editing Preferences" (section 8.4.8).

9.7  TEXTRA v1.11 changed it's gadget imagery to be like 
that in Workbench 2.0.  While this color scheme still looks quite 
attractive under the standard Workbench 1.3 and earlier colors, 
1.3 users often customized them in radically different ways.  For 
example, instead of something of intermediate brightness for the 
background color (color 0...WB 1.3 used pale blue), using black 
causes the shaded-gadget imagery of 2.0 to appear very odd.  For 
this reason, TEXTRA v1.11 will render it's requester and gadget 
imagery, under Workbench 1.3 and earlier, for the most part in 
monochrome (colors 0 and 1).  Boolean gadgets (checkboxes) are 
also rendered differently.
