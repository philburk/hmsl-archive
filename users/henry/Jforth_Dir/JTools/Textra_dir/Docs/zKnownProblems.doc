	This is intended to be a relatively complete list of the
	idiosyncrasies known or suspected with TEXTRA.  I've tried
	to be relatively complete in describing each situation.
	
	Eventually, I'd like to completely eradicate this list,
	but <sigh!> all in due time.  For now, take heed of hither...

--------------------------------------------------------------
TEXTRA will alternately select and operate on each window
when either the "Project, Save All Files" menu item or
when QUITing.  During these operations, problems MAY occur
if the user manually selects a different window than TEXTRA has
selected.  (I say MAY because Phil only suspects he's seen
problems here.)

Also, some AREXX scripts will eventually select other windows
(when I add this capability to the TEXTRA command set).

For now, just "leave the machine alone" during these times,
and as far as I know, things work fine.

NOTE: While printing, it IS OK to switch windows, edit, save,
whatever.  The above 'note' doesn't apply for printing.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Avoid low memory situations.  Error recovery apparently isn't
what it should be in some cases.  Try to make sure there's
at least 40K free in your computer.  This is a high priority
item with me, and I've already improved this version somewhat
in this respect.

As far as I know, all other TEXTRA memory-management issues
are solid...no enforcer hits...always gives everything back...
uses the right memory (CHIP vs. other) for the job...etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------
While an AREXX script is running...

	1. Editing of other windows may not be performed.
	
	2. Any print job is suspended (until the script is done).
	   You won't even notice this one unless you're running one
	   HECKUVA l-o-n-g AREXX script!
	
	3. Don't change the selected window until the operation
	   is complete.
