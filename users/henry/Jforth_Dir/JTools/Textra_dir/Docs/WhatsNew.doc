!!!NEW!!!!!!NEW!!!!!!NEW!!!!!!  In V1.11  !!!!!!NEW!!!!!!NEW!!!!!!NEW!!!


Graphics/gadget-imagery  now Workbench 2.0-oriented. 
(Under 1.3 and earlier, requesters & gadgets now appear primarily
monochrome.)

New WrapAt.textra AREXX script.  Select a paragraph or paragraphs,
then try WRAPAT 60. (Assuming paragraphs are separated by a blank
line)

While printing, TEXTRA v1.11 should not significantly slow down other
processes anymore.

Fixed a bug where, if an AREXX script called GET CURSOR CHAR 
when the cursor was at the end of a line, very strange (and 
usually bad) things would happen later on.



In V1.10...

The BIG, BIG news is, of course the AREXX port (TREXXTRA?!!?).
See the file RexxCommand.doc for details on the TEXTRA/AREXX
command set available and other special notes.

Added Preference item for stripping CR from CR,LF sequences when
reading in the file.

Added horiz scroll gadget.

Fixed 'Open by Name...' to NOT ask for floppy, if ejected.

Changed up & down arrow keys to center the cursor line if off-screen.

Made 'keyboard help' prettier, more complete.

Cleaned-up arrow gadget images

Change window sizing so that if necessary, last line of file
will 'move down' do a new 'bottom of window'.



!!!BUGS!!!!!!BUGS!!!!!!  FIXED In V1.10  !!!!!!BUGS!!!!!!BUGS!!!

Enforcer CLEAN!  (At least *I* can't squeeze any more outta it!)
                 (Let me know if *YOU* can!)

Fixed printing problem with leading space at beginning of each line

Trying to exceed a line length of 255 used to crash.  not anymore.

'Go To Line' on last line (the always-empty one) would cause it
to become selected all the way 'cross the screen (inferring a next line).
This would cause bad array pointers and the like to be used for virtually
any further operations, and ultimately a crash.  fixed.

Up- or down-arrow into middle of TAB would cause problems

With only one blank line at the eof, select FROM past eol on
line last-2 TO last.  Hitting backspace caused last-1 to stay visible.

Fixed problem where double-click, even if curs pos changed, would
not allow drag select on second click.

Under 2.0, in Super-Hires (1280-wide screen), the F1 key didn't 
enlarge to full-width (just half-width, 640) AND didn't return to
small size when hit again.

If, while opening a file, a line was longer than 255, the open would stop at
that line with no error message.  The (partial) file could be written out,
destroying the (complete) original.  Now, Textra wraps the line and
informs the user of such and the open continues to completion.

Incorporated Commodore's CloseWindowSafely() algorithm.  Earlier stuff
could, on rare occasion, crash.  New stuff also feels much 'snappier'
when closing windows (takes much less time).

Fixed problem where funny text would sometimes corrupt "open file"
requester when diving down into a directory that was double-clicked.

Fixed random write when closing files individually (thanks, enforcer)

Fixed random read resulting in possible (but unlikely) crash
in some instances of string gadget usage.  (thanks, enforcer)
