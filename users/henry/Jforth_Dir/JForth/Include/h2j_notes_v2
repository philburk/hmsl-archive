Notes on include files. Version 2.0

Please note that executable colon definitions, eg. to
replace macros, should not be defined in .j files.
They would not work in MODULES.
All constants, and structure references generate inline
code so the original .j code is not needed after compilation
is complete.

Most of the files were translated directly from the ".h"
file.  Where the ".j" files had special treatment is 
described below.

One of the biggest differences between JForth version 1.2
and version 2.0 is that the include files now support
signed members, ie. USHORT and SHORT are now different.
There are also some newly defined constants and structures.
There are also some bug fixes.

JI:DEVICES --------------------------------------

NARRATOR.J - I added a "ndi_" prefix to the narrator_rb
members, and a "mrb" prefix to the mouth_rb members,
like in the .i files.

JI:EXEC ----------------------------

LISTS.J - The Amiga .h include file had l_pad instead of lh_pad
like in the manual.  I UNIONed them together so you can use
either one.

PORTS.J - Fixed MP_SOFTINT

TASKS.J - Note that TASK is named EXEC_TASK to avoid a naming
conflict.  You can : TASK EXEC_TASK ; if you want.

TYPES.J - is not relevant to Forth, it is here just so
that an include won't bomb.

JI:GRAPHICS -------------------------------------

COPPER.J - CopIns has nested UNIONs. Check it out!

RASTPORT.J - Warning GelsInfo has to be quadword aligned!
This doesn't happen automatically, see JU:FILE-TOOLS for
QUAD-ALIGN.

GRAPHINT.J - I put is_ prefixes on the structure members.

JI:INTUITION -----------------------------------

INTUITION.J - The Preferences structure in JForth 1.2 had
some missing members. This has been fixed.

INT_SMALL.J - This is a small version of INTUITION.J that
can be used if you don't need everything INTUITION.J has.

INTUITIONBASE.J - Avoid using this File.  It is provided
by Amiga for education but it is full of danger.
It ALL may change between versions!

JI:LIBRARIES -----------------------------------

CONFIGREGS.J and CONFIGVARS.J had macros which could not
be put in the .J file.

MATHFFP.H was full of floating point constants and 
function declarations that aren't needed in JForth.

EXPANSION.J had actual data structures declared which would
not be disposable! Therefore, it was not included.

DOS.J now has correct definitions for ID_UNREADABLE_DISK
and ID_DOS_DISK .
