\ ------------------ IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTICE ------------------------
\
\
\ NOTE: the application may not execute any part of the
\       JForth compiler once the image has been TURNKEYED!
\
\       The agreement between you and Delta Research, made
\       when you began to use JForth, specifically does NOT
\       permit the use of the JForth compiler algorithms (any
\       code-producing component of the JForth development
\       environment) in any program produced and release
\       to any group or individual.
\
\
\
\ ----------- SEE THE TURNKEY DOCUMENT IN THE DOC: DRAWER ----------
\
\
\
\ Usage:   TURNKEY start-application-word   'quit'-word   filename
\
\ where:
\
\ start-application-word ...
\
\ the topmost word in the 'turnkeyed application, must do
\ ALL Amiga init stuff ... open windows, libraries ('cept for
\ EXEC and DOS), etc.  Forth engine will be initialized
\ for you.  
\
\ 'quit'-word ...
\
\ the word that will be placed in the 'QUIT' vector; it should
\ initialize the application such that it may either recover from
\ the indicated error OR execute BYE, returning to the CLI environment.
\
\   EXAMPLE:   Turnkey  MyGame Bye df1:TheGameFile
\
\

.need doscode
tib 26 - constant doscode
.then


\ This program may not be modified and MUST be executed in its entirity
\ before an application written in JForth may be released!
