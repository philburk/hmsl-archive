\ Use the DOS delay function for an approximate
\ time delay.  It uses software timing for fractions
\ of 20 milliseconds which is calibrated for the Amiga 1000.
\ this will be slightly inaccurate on an Amiga 3000.
\
\ MOD: PLB 6/2/90 Check for 0 or 1 being passed to DELAY
\     Calling DELAY() with 0 or 1 causes DOS errors!
\ MOD: PLB 9/6/91 Abandon the use of the DOS_LIB Delay
\	function because the V1.3 version can cause disk
\	errors even at 15 ticks!  Use WaitTOF instead.
\	Yes I know this is a kludge.  This is just a VERY
\	CHEAP and DIRTY kind of delay.  NOT accurate.
