You should have a large screen to see the whole thing.\par \pard \fi-360\li360\sl360 \par \pard \sl360 {\b IMPORTANT: Get rid of OMS, Free Midi, etc. from your system folder. }{\b\i EK}{\b  uses it's own MIDI driver. }{\b\i EK}{\b  will not send MIDI if there are other MIDI drivers in the system folder. \par }\pard \sl360 \par \pard \fi-360\li360\sl360 If you are using a PowerPC, or one of the new Powerbooks, call me or email me, I haven't\par \pard \fi-360\li360\sl360 tried it yet, and I may need to make a simple fix to get MIDI to run on those.\par (I run it on Quadras mostly.)\par \par {\b What to do}\par \pard \fi-360\li1080\sl360 \bullet  Connect up to 16 channels of MIDI synth to your Mac\par \bullet  Get rid of OMS, FreeMIDI, from your system folder (probably restart).\par \pard \fi-360\li1080\sl360 \bullet  After double clicking on the {\i EK} application, click on GO (the piece will start running).\par \pard \fi-360\li1080\sl360 \bullet  The piece will run fine, and pretty much forever, continually making changes as it goes. If you want to interact with it, you need to know what all the boxes do (they do a lot!). The rest of this document describes them.\par \pard \fi-360\li1080\sl360 \par \pard {\b The }{\b\i EK}{\b  Screen}\par \par \pard \par \pard \par \pard \sl360 {\b About the }{\b\i EK}{\b  Program\par }\pard \sl360 This computer program is a realization of Daniel Goode\rquote s score, which you should consult to see the musical ideas referred to below. The program contains some options that are not explicitly \ldblquote allowed\rdblquote  in the original, but you don\rquote t have to use these if you don\rquote t want to.\par \pard \sl360 \par \pard \sl360 Every time the program completes a \ldblquote repeat\rdblquote  of the one-page score, it chooses a new set of values for all the voices. You\rquote ll see the values change on the screen. You can, in some cases, affect the ranges from which those values will be chosen. Although the score specifies that you can\rquote t change a musical idea until you\rquote ve repeated the tune twice, this program allows you to set the {\i #-repeats} that it will do before choosing a new set of values. The default is 2.\par \pard \fi-360\li360\sl360 \par {\b About the }{\b\i EK}{\b  Screen}\par \pard \sl360 The {\i rows} are the 16 midi channels (performers, voices). The {\i columns} are the different parameters for each voice, controllable by the user. The program selects new values for each voice in each parameter for each new repeat, if that parameter (column) is enabled for choosing. \par \pard \sl360 \par \pard \sl360 Under each column (except the voice {\i on} and {\i behav}) is a single box which allows the user to globally force all the voices in that parameter to one value. This can be very useful for specific musical effects, such as changing all the fundamentals, or loudnesses together.\par \pard \sl360 \par \pard \sl360 The boxes at the center bottom of the screen ({\i tempo}, {\i preset-limit}, {\i skip/step%}, {\i #-repeats}, {\i ctrl-#}, {\i max-jitter}, {\i e-buffer}) are for controlling more global aspects of the piece. They will be described below in detail.\par \pard \sl360 \par \pard \sl360 The 10 sliders ({\i Voice Behavior Probabilities}) are for controlling the likelihood of any given voice choosing one of 10 different musical behaviors for a given repeat. These are described below.\par \pard \sl360 \par {\b The Columns\par }\pard \sl360 Below each column of 16 voices (except for {\i on} and {\i behav}) are two boxes, one with a number in it, one with a question mark. These affect the columns globally, that is, they affect all 16 voices at once. They\rquote ll be described below. The individual cells in the column each affect one voice.\par \pard \sl360 {\b \par }\pard \fi360\sl360 \bullet  {\i on/off\par }\pard \li720\sl360 This turns a voice on or off, or shows whether or not a voice has been turned on or off on a given repeat. The probability of a voice turning on or off is controlled by the {\i dens} (density) column, and goes from 0 (no possibility) to 100 (turns on every time). Different voices are different MIDI channels.{\i \par }\pard \fi360\sl360 {\i \bullet  pre\par }\pard \li720\sl360 This selects a preset or program number for a voice. You can also set a limit for the highest preset number the piece will choose (when it is doing the choosing) in the box in the bottom center called {\i preset limit}.{\i \par }\pard \fi360\sl360 {\i \bullet  behav\par }\pard \li720\sl360 You cannot alter anything in this column, it\rquote s for display only. This column tells you what \ldblquote behavior\rdblquote  the voice is in for a given repeat. The behaviors are, according to Goode\rquote s score:\par \pard \li720\sl360 \par \pard \fi720\li720\sl360 \emdash  play the melody ({\i mel})\par \emdash  invert the melody ({\i inv})\par \emdash  sustain one note through the melody ({\i sus})\par \emdash  play equal eighth notes on one pitch through the rests ({\i rhythm})\par \emdash  play only the high notes of the melody ({\i hi})\par \emdash  play only the low notes of the melody ({\i lo})\par \emdash  play the low and high notes of the melody ({\i lohi})\par \emdash  accent the high notes of the melody ({\i >hi})\par \emdash  accent the low notes of the melody ({\i >lo})\par \emdash  accent the low and high notes of the melody ({\i >lohi})\par \par \pard \li720\sl360 The probability of picking one of these 10 different behaviors is controlled by the {\i Voice Behavior Probabilities} sliders on the bottom right of the screen. The probabilities for any given behavior range from 0->100. Next to the individual boxes in the {\i behav} column, the name of the behavior currently in use is displayed.\par \pard \fi360\sl360 \bullet  {\i fund\par }\pard \li720\sl360 This column shows and allows you to change the fundamental pitch for each voice, to which the step and skip are added (or subtracted in the case of the inverting behavior). If the voice selects its own fundamental for a repeat, the value will be in the range specified by the two columns{\i  f-lo} and {\i f-hi}. This fundamental will also be the note used by the sustain and rhythm behaviors.{\i \par }\pard \fi360\sl360 \bullet  {\i loud\par }\pard \li720\sl360 The numbers in this column range from 0-20, and scale the loudness of each voice. To make a voice louder, raise the number, to make it quieter, lower it.{\i \par }\pard \fi360\sl360\keep\keepn \bullet  {\i dens\par }\pard \li720\sl360\keep\keepn This column is the probability of a voice being turned on for the next repeat. It ranges from 0-100.{\i \par }\pard \fi360\sl360 \bullet  {\i f-lo\par }\pard \li720\sl360 This column is the lower limit for the choice of a new fundamental for the voice.{\i \par }\pard \fi360\sl360 \bullet  {\i f-hi\par }\pard \li720\sl360 This column is the higher limit for the choice of a new fundamental for the voice.{\i \par }\pard \fi360\sl360 \bullet  {\i bend\par }\pard \li720\sl360 Numbers in this column range from 0-100, and control the amount of pitch bend that will be sent for a given voice with each note. The numbers control the percent of the total pitch bend range, and the actual pitch bend values sent are randomly chosen from between 0 and +- the range. For a simple detuning, set your MIDI synthesizer to have a pitch bend range of 1 semitone.{\i \par }\pard \fi360\sl360 \bullet  {\i crtl\par }\pard \li720\sl360 The numbers in this column range from 0-100, and control the amount of some MIDI controller that will be sent for a given voice for each note. The numbers control the percent of the total pitch controller value range. The actual pitch controller values sent are randomly chosen from between 0 and 127 (depending on the % value in the box). By changing the value in the box called {\i ctrl-#} on the bottom center of the screen, the MIDI controller # to which the values are sent is changed. 10, the default, is the usual controller number for panning. By setting different MIDI channels to respond differently to the same controller #, a wide variety of effects can be created using this feature.\par \pard \fi360\sl360 \bullet  {\i step\par }\pard \li720\sl360 Picks the step size in semitones for the melody. The skip size is recomputed every time, as something between 2 and 4 times the step size.{\i \par }\pard \fi360\sl360 \bullet  {\i stacc\par }\pard \li720\sl360 Picks a staccato value for the voice, between 0-100% of the duration of the notes. This will affect different MIDI programs in different ways. Basically, it determines when the noteoff will be sent. (in terms of the % of the total duration). {\i \par }\pard \fi360\sl360 \bullet  {\i jitter\par }\pard \li720\sl360 My five year old daughter Anna (who plays with this piece a lot at home) calls this the \ldblquote crazy\rdblquote  place. Values for jitter determine the amount of duration error around the pulse for a given voice. Values below 10 will make the piece just a little bit \ldblquote sloppy\rdblquote  (or lifelike perhaps), greater values will produce odd effects. The voice come back in sync at the beginning of each repeat. Values for jitter are percentages of the total duration of the current pulse. You can set the maximum jitter value that will be chosen for the voices on each new repeat in the box at the bottom center called {\i max-jitter}.\par \pard \sl360 \par {\b Global Column Parameters (under each column)}\par \pard \fi360\sl360 \bullet  {\i numeric parameters\par }\pard \li720\sl360 Below each column is a box with a number in it. Changing that number will force all the voices to that value in that parameter. There is no global changer for the behavior or on/off column. If you want all voices to go on and stay on for the next repeat, turn them all on and turn off the choose enable (or set all their {\i dens} values to 100, which will turn them all on for the next repeat).\par \pard \fi360\sl360 \bullet  {\i choosing on/off}\par \pard \li720\sl360 By blackening and un-blackening the question marks, the possibility of choosing new\par \pard \li720\sl360 values in that particular parameter in the next repeat are enabled and disabled. If you want the program to choose new values for a given parameter, click on this box and make it black. If you don\rquote t, click on it and un-blacken it.\par \pard \sl360 \par {\b Global Parameters (bottom center of the screen)\par }\pard \li360\sl360 \bullet  {\i tempo\par }\pard \li720\sl360 This selects the number of eighth notes per minute. \par \pard \fi360\sl360 \bullet  {\i preset-limit\par }\pard \li720\sl360 This number is the highest preset that the program will choose for a given voice. For example, if your synth only has 30 presets, set it to 30.\par \pard \fi360\sl360 \bullet  {\i skip/step%\par }\pard \li720\sl360 Daniel Goode\rquote s score says that when the melody is played, it can be skip followed by step, or step followed by skip. This number sets the likelihood of picking one of those behaviors over another when {\i mel}, {\i inv}, {\i >lo}, {\i >hi}, or {\i >lohi} are chosen. The higher the number, the more likely a voice is to use a melody which is a step followed by skip.\par \pard \fi360\sl360 \bullet  {\i #-repeats\par }\pard \li720\sl360 This number is the number of times the one page score will be played before selecting new values for all parameters enabled. Daniel Goode\rquote s score says that performers should remain on a set of choices for at least two times through, but in this program, you can select 1.\par \pard \fi360\sl360 \bullet  {\i ctrl-#\par }\pard \li720\sl360 This selects the MIDI controller number to which the {\i ctrl} values are sent for each note. The default is 10, which is often pan.{\i \par }\pard \fi360\sl360 \bullet  {\i max-jitter\par }\pard \li720\sl360 This number is the maximum jitter value that will be selected for voices for each repeat. Keep it low (below 10) for a kind of \ldblquote human\rdblquote  effect. Higher than that, things get strange.\par \pard \fi360\sl360 \bullet  {\i e-buffer\par }\pard \li720\sl360 This should generally be left alone, but might be useful if, for example, you\rquote re running {\i EK} on a really slow Macintosh. This number sets the length of the HMSL event buffer. The longer the buffer, the more accurately things will compute (that is, there won\rquote t be time deformations as the computer \ldblquote thinks\rdblquote ) but the program will always be that amount of time behind \ldblquote real-time\rdblquote  (that shouldn\rquote t affect much in this piece). The number is in 60ths of a second.\par \pard \sl360 \par {\b Voice Behavior Probabilities}\par \pard \sl360 The faders at the bottom right of the screen are a set of probability histograms for the various types of behavior mentioned in the score and described above: melody, sustain through the melody, playing the rhythms on the held notes, invert the melody, accent the low, high, or high and low notes, just play the low, high, or low and high notes.\par \pard \sl360 \par {\b Acknowledgments}\par \pard \sl360 {\i Eine Kleine }{\i\strike Gamelan}{\i  Computer Music} was developed as part of a residency at P.A.S.S in NYC\par by Dan and Larry.
