PLEASE READ FIRST !!!!!!!!!!.fDear HMSL User,Thank you for purchasing HMSL.We hope that HMSL will be useful to you in your musical explorations.Since HMSL is an experimental language, we are continuallyworking on improving the language.HMSL V4.10 Preliminary -------------------------------------HMSL V4.10 has many new features which are describedin appendix D. Version 4.10 has a fewrough edges but we felt it was better to release it nowso that people can start using the new stuff.  Wewill release a final version, V4.2, later this year.Version 4.2 will have an improved Sequencer, improvedFader Controls, improved manual, etc.  The Macintoshversion will have a 68000 assembler.Input on these changes is very welcome.We have tried to catch all of the errors and bugs in HMSLbut a few have slipped through.  If you notice any othermistakes, please let us know.We would also appreciate knowing about any areas thatyou feel could be improved.  (Yes, we know we need an indexand are working on that.  It is difficult to do.)----------------------------------------------------.! .include amiganotes.p.include macnotes.p------------------------------------------------------FILE TRANSFER - There is a very new, undocumented system for transferringtext files between two computers using MIDI. Connect twocomputers, OUT to IN, IN to OUT, for two way communication.	INCLUDE HT:FILE__XFEROn receiver, enter:	RECV.FILEOn sender, enter: 	XMIT.FILE  filenameThe file will be saved under the same name on the receiver.Use ASSIGN names for convenience.As an example, suppose you want to send a file fromthe Mac called HWORK:MYPIECE to the Amiga's RAM disk.On the Amiga enter:	RECV.FILE	On the Macintosh, enter:	ASSIGN  RAM:  HWORK:	XMIT.FILE  RAM:MYPIECE	The file will end up on the Amiga as RAM:MYPIECE.Suggestions welcome.------------------------------------------------------Please make the following changes to your HMSL V4.0 manuals:CHAPTER 8, TUTORIAL 2:To the definition of SC.INIT, add:	ACT.SEQUENTIAL:  SCOL1Please note that when you define this tutorial,it will tell you that SC.INIT and SC.TERM are REDEFINED.This is because SC.INIT and SC.TERM are already definedas words that initialize and terminate the interactiveScreen system.  This is harmless but will be changed.CHAPTER 13, PAGE 14, Example of LOAD.ABS.SHAPEPlease replace the example given with the following:.nfOB.SHAPE SH1OB.PLAYER PL1OB.MIDI.INSTRUMENT INS1: READ.MF  ( -- , read track 0 of a midifile into a shape )	0 " hmf:simple.mf" $$mf.load.shape  \ loads as absolute expanded	mf-shape sh1 sh.compress.notes     \ convert to compressed;: PLAY.MF  ( -- , play the shape read from MIDIFile )    sh1 ins1 build: pl1     0 put.offset: ins1     \ 0 offset because stored as MIDI notes    use.absolute.time: pl1 \ absolute not relative time    3 put.on.dim: pl1      \ use ontimes of compressed notes    pl1 hmsl.play;.f----------------------------------------------------Appendix A is not finished.You can get the same information on each class, for example OB.PLAYER,by entering:	METHODS.OF  OB.PLAYER	INHERITANCE.OF OB.PLAYERScore Entry System -----------------------------------Users have reported synchronizationproblems when using ACCEL{ in parallel sections.We are working on improving ACCEL{ which requiresaccurate calculate of exponential curves.We have also added to tools for enforcing synchronization:	ZERO.SYNC  ( -- , zero reference for sync )	SET.SYNC  ( n -- , record a sync point )	SYNC.TO  ( n -- , synchronize to point N )You may have up to 8 sync points so N can be 0-7.These work by saving and restoring VTIME and theroundoff error accumulator..tp 5Bulletin Board System --------------------------------Robert Marsanyi has kindly agreed to host a bulletinboard using FIDO BBS software.You can log in to gettechnical help, trade ideas, announce concerts,report bugs, etc.We are hoping to maintain this as a free serviceas long as possible.You can dial in 24 hours per day at 1200 or 2400 baud at:	(415) 928-8246We encourage you to use the BBS for getting technical help.We are hoping that the more experienced users canhelp newcomers to HMSL by answering questions.If you have a question the answer may already be on the BBS.If you need some emergency assistance or have somethingwhich cannot be easily done on the BBS,you may contact me at:	(415) 461-1442Network Communication ------------------------You can also reach us over BITNET.If you have an email address that we can reach through BITNET,please send it to us since we will occasionally send HMSLnews over the networks.  When we receive a BITNET addresswe will send a test message to test our link.  If you donot get a reply within a few weeks, please let us know thatour communication failed.  Our BITNET addresses are:	phil@mills.berkeley.edu	larry.polansky@mac.dartmouth.eduLarry Polansky is a faculty member at Dartmouth.David Rosenboom is Director of the Music Department at Cal Arts.Phil Burk is a researcher at the Mills College Center for Contemporary Music.HMSL Cassette ---------------------------------Frog Peak has just released a cassette tape with the musicof 12 composers who used HMSL in various ways.The tape includes extensive notes on the pieces.It is available for $$8.00 from Frog Peak and is called"one.source: HMSL".It is excellent and highly recommended for HMSL users whowant to hear what other folks have done.We will be producing more tapes, and possibly CDs, in the futureso let us know if you would like to be included.Keep Us Informed -----------------------------Please let us know about any concerts or recording projectsinvolving HMSL.  This information may be published in our newsletteror other journals.If you have any tapes, we would LOVE to hear them.I am collecting music for radio shows and cassettes so send 'em in.I would also like to hear about experiences with using HMSLto teach computer music.Bugs, Suggestions, Comments -------------------Yes please.  You may not think that we enjoy hearingbug reports from users but they are VERY HELPFUL.We test as thoroughly as we can but HMSL is a big, open ended systemso we can easily miss small bugs.If you could keep a log of your reactions to the HMSLsoftware and manual as you compile it and learn it,that would be EXTREMELY useful.We would also like to hear suggestions for future developments.Thanks again,Phil Burk
